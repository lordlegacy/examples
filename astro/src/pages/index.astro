			<h1>ðŸš€ Testing Dokploy Deployment</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to our Dokploy testing environment! This site is designed to help test and validate 
				<a href="https://dokploy.com/">Dokploy</a> deployment workflows with various application types,
				configurations, and deployment scenarios.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dokploy is a modern deployment platform that simplifies the process of deploying applications
				with features like automatic SSL, domain management, and container orchestration. This Astro site
				serves as a perfect candidate for testing static site deployments.
			</p>
			<p>Here's what we're testing with this deployment:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Static site generation and build process validation</li>
				<li>Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal</li>
				<li>Custom domain configuration and DNS routing</li>
				<li>Build optimization and caching strategies</li>
				<li>Environment variable injection and configuration</li>
				<li>Rollback capabilities and deployment history</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This testing approach helps ensure reliable deployments before moving to production environments.
				We monitor build times, resource usage, and deployment success rates to optimize our workflow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Key metrics we track: Build time (~2-3 minutes), Bundle size optimization (target &lt;1MB), 
				and deployment reliability (99.9% success rate). Check out our 
				<a href="/blog">deployment logs</a> for detailed insights.
